      <description>2 packages are distributed on CRAN by BNOSAC and they allow R users to automate R processes on specific timepoints from R itself.
 One package for scheduling R scripts and processes on Windows (taskscheduleR) and Another package for scheduling R scripts and processes on Unix/Linux(cronR)  This blog only covers cronR on Linux/Unix system. To make it easy for beginning R users, an Rstudio addin was developed. The RStudio addin basically allows you to select an R script and schedule it at specific timepoints.</description>
