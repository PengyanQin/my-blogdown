<p>2 packages are distributed on CRAN by <a href="http://www.bnosac.be">BNOSAC</a> and they allow R users to automate R processes on specific timepoints from R itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>One package for scheduling R scripts and processes on Windows (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taskscheduleR/index.html">taskscheduleR</a>) and</li>
<li>Another package for scheduling R scripts and processes on Unix/Linux(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cronR/index.html">cronR</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog only covers cronR on Linux/Unix system. To make it easy for beginning R users, an Rstudio addin was developed. The RStudio addin basically allows you to select an R script and schedule it at specific timepoints. It does this by copying the script to your launch/log folder and setting up a cronjob for that script. Next we’ll see how to install and use this addin.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level3">
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The package is on CRAN. To install, just run</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&#39;cronR&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>To add Rstudio addin, also install miniUI, shiny and shinyFiles</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&#39;miniUI&#39;)
install.packages(&#39;shiny&#39;)
install.packages(&#39;shinyFiles&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>RStudio addin</h3>
<p>Just click Addins &gt; Schedule R scripts on Linux/Unix in the top bar, then the Cron job scheduler pops up.

<ul>
<li><strong>Select file</strong>: choose the R script you want to automate, then the entire path would be copied to <strong>Selected Rscript</strong></li>
<li><strong>Launch date</strong> and <strong>Launch hour</strong>: when will the cronjob be executed for the first time, the default value is the current time in Central European Summer Time (CEST)</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>: how often will the cronjob be executed, if the predefined frequency is not applicable, check ASIS to customize the frequency for your cronjob</li>
<li><strong>ASIS cron schedule</strong>: use cron schedule expression to customize your cronjob frequency, the syntax and example can be found <a href="https://crontab.guru/">here</a></li>
<li><strong>Job description</strong>: a short description of the job and its purpose</li>
<li><strong>Job tags</strong>: optional; a set of tags, used for easy listing and retrieval of cron jobs</li>
<li><strong>Additional arguments to Rscript</strong>: optional; provide the inputs to the Rscripts if needed</li>
<li><strong>Job identifier</strong>: an identification to give the cronjob task for easier revision in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>After creating the job, you can manage existing jobs in the addin as well.

<ul>
<li><strong>Show current crontab schedule</strong> would display all existing cronjob schedules, it doesn’t matter whether they are saved to crontab or not, except when <strong>Load selected schedule</strong>, only saved cronjobs in the crontab would be displayed.</li>
<li>To check one specific job in the current schedule, you can <strong>Select job</strong> by Job identifier to <strong>Show job</strong> or <strong>Delete job</strong> explicitly.</li>
<li><strong>Save Crontab</strong> enables you to save all current cronjob schedules to a .cron file, then you can load this cron file by <strong>Select crontab schedule</strong> and <strong>Load selected schedule</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If a cronjob is scheduled but not saved in crontab, after loading another selected schedule, the unsaved cronjob would be deleted automatically. So I would recommend always saving your cronjob to crontab schedule explicitly.</p>
